\textbf{Background:}\\
- Quadratic Polynomial Concentration: Consider a quadratic polynomial in ${n}$ independent Rademacher random variables ${\xi_1, \xi_2,...,\xi_n}$ meaning ${Pr(\xi_i=1)=Pr(\xi_i=-1)=0.5}$ for each ${i}$:
$${f(\xi)=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a_{ij} \xi_i \xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i \xi_i + c}$$
where ${a_{ij},b_i}$ and ${c}$ are coefficients, and the polynomial is said to exhibit significant concentration if for some value ${x}$, the probability ${Pr(\xi=x)}$ exceeds a certain threshold, indicating that ${f(\xi)}$ is closely concentrated around ${x}$.\\\newline
- Point Probability: Can be represented as ${P(f(\xi_1, \xi_2,...,\xi_n) = k)}$ where ${k}$ is a specific value.\\\newline
- A Ramsey graph is a concept from graph theory that is closely related to Ramsey's theorem, one of the central results in combinatorial mathematics. The theorem addresses the conditions under which a graph must contain a certain structure. Specifically, Ramsey's theorem states that for any given integers ${r}$ and ${s}$, there exists a least integer ${N=R(r,s)}$ such that any graph on ${N}$ or more vertices, no matter how its edges are colored using two colors (say, red and blue), will contain either a red clique of size ${r}$ or a blue clique of size ${s}$. A clique here refers to a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\\\newline
The article introduces inverse theorems of a similar flavour to Costello’s conjecture, showing that if a quadratic polynomial exhibits point probabilities significantly larger than ${1/n}$, it must be close to a low-rank quadratic form. This is achieved through a detailed analysis involving the arrangement of coefficients and the algebraic structure of the polynomial.\\\newline
The authors in the given paper focused on the quadratic Littlewood-Offord problem by examining the concentration of quadratic polynomials in independent Bernoulli random variables. They extended classical questions about linear polynomials to the quadratic case, exploring the conditions under which a quadratic polynomial can have significant point probabilities. Their main results, as summarized in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, establish a remarkable connection between the anti-concentration of a quadratic polynomial $f(\xi)$ and the algebraic structure of $f$. Specifically, they demonstrated that if a quadratic polynomial has a concentration probability significantly larger than $\frac{1}{n}$, it must be close to a quadratic form with low rank.\\\newline
In Theorem 1.1, for any given $r \geq 3$ and $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$, they identified a constant $C = C(r, \epsilon)$ such that for a quadratic polynomial $f \in F[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ (where $F$ is either $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{Q}$) with all coefficients of absolute value at most 1, and $\xi = (\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n) \in \text{Rad}^n$, if ${\sup_{x \in F} \Pr(f(\xi) = x) \geq C \cdot \frac{(\log n)^{r/2}}{n^{1-2/(r+2)}}}$,
then there exists a quadratic form $h \in F[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ of rank strictly less than $r$ such that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of $f - h$ is at most $\epsilon n^2$.\\\newline
Theorem 1.2 follows a similar line of reasoning but focuses on the scenario where the quadratic polynomial ${f}$'s degree-2 coefficients come from a specific set $S$. It states that under similar conditions of anti-concentration, there exists a quadratic form $h$ close to ${f}$, differing in at most $\epsilon n^2$ coefficients, and also has a rank strictly less than $r$.\\\newline
Beyond the theoretical advancements, this paper extends its findings to the study of Ramsey graphs, specifically addressing and providing asymptotic answers to questions previously posed by Kwan, Sudakov, and Tran. This application highlights the interplay between discrete mathematics and algebraic probability, demonstrating the practical relevance of algebraic characterizations of quadratic polynomials in understanding the structure and randomness inherent in Ramsey graphs. By analyzing the edge counts within Ramsey graphs through the framework of quadratic polynomials—using entries from the graphs' adjacency matrices—the study delves into the anti-concentration properties of these graphs. For a Ramsey graph $G$ with an adjacency matrix $A$, the investigation into the edge counts of randomly chosen vertex subsets reveals insights into the graph's structure, akin to the properties observed in random graphs. The researchers applied principles from the quadratic Littlewood–Offord problem to explore the distribution of edge counts in subsets of vertices within C-Ramsey graphs. They focused on determining whether, for a randomly selected subset of $n/2$ vertices in an $n$-vertex C-Ramsey graph, the probability that the induced subgraph contains exactly $x$ edges adheres to $O(1/n)$ for all $x$. Such a finding would suggest that the edge distribution in Ramsey graphs does not overly concentrate around any specific edge count, reflecting a characteristic commonly associated with random graphs.
