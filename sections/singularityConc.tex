\textbf(Collectively,} these articles significantly enhance the understanding of random matrix singularity, demonstrating a remarkable progression from focusing on the specific case of symmetric matrices to a broader application involving various types of discrete random matrices. The leap from Campos et al.'s improved bounds and methodologies to Jain, Sah, and Sawhney's resolution of longstanding conjectures and precision in probability estimates exemplifies a vibrant trajectory of research that broadens the horizon of mathematical inquiry into random matrices. Their findings not only underscore the complexity and richness of random matrices as a subject but also pave the way for future explorations in this captivating area of mathematics.\\\\
