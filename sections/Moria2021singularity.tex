~\cite{jain2021singularity}
The article discusses the singularity of discrete n $\times$ n random matrices ${M_n}(\xi)$, focusing on matrices with non-constant real-valued random variables $\xi$. 
It explores the probability of singularity $ \mathbb{P}[M_n$ is singular$]=\mathbb{P}[$zero row or column$]+ (1+o_n(1))\mathbb{P}[$two equal (up to sign) rows or columns$]$ in these random matrices and confirm a conjecture related to this topic. 
They provide precise results for various scenarios, including cases involving Bernoulli distributions:\\
\textbf{For Bernoulli Distribution with} $\rho \in (0, 1/2)$:
$\mathbb{P}[M_n$ is singular$]=2n(1-\rho)^n + (1+o_n(1))n(n-1)(\rho^2+(1-\rho)^2)^2$.\\
\textbf{For Bernoulli Distribution with} $\rho \in (1/2, 1)$:
$\mathbb{P}[M_n$ is singular$]=(1+o_n(1))n(n-1)(\rho^2+(1-\rho)^2)^2$.
One key aspect of the study is the analysis of the contribution of the 'compressible' part of the unit sphere into 'structured' and 'unstructured' components to the lower tail of the smallest singular value of the matrices.
By examining this contribution, the researchers aim to gain a deeper understanding of the processes occurring in these random matrices and identify the impact of specific subsets on the singular behavior of the matrices.
In this article the novelties are:
Unlike "structured" vectors with similar components, "unstructured" vectors in random matrices have diverse values. The authors exploit this non-uniformity to analyze them. They introduce a novel "multi-slice" theorem to handle these vectors, overcoming challenges of dependence and non-integer values. This method offers a powerful tool for understanding how unstructured vectors influence the invertibility of random matrices, building upon previous work on simpler cases.
