\subsection{Overview}
The articles condenses insights on Ramsey graph
anticoncentration and the 
quadratic Littlewood-Offord algebraic inverse theorem.
The work of Matthew Kwan, A. Sah, L. Saurmann, and M. Sawhney
 \cite{kwan2022anticoncentration} examines edge-statistics in C-Ramsey graphs, employing quadratic Gaussian chaos and the Carbery-Wright theorem to explore small-ball probabilities and their implications for Ramsey graph analysis.

Additionally, \cite{kwan2019algebraic} introduces quadratic approximation bounds and constrained coefficient approximation, enhancing our understanding of anti-concentration in complex quadratic polynomials. Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 highlight conditions for identifying lower-rank quadratic forms with minimal coefficient deviation, while Theorem 1.3 shows
edge count anti-concentration in C-Ramsey graphs, akin to random graph distributions.
