\section{Introduction}


In the realm of high-dimensional data analysis, random matrices have captivated the attention of mathematicians and scientists due to their ubiquitous presence in various domains, including computer science, statistics, and machine learning. Understanding their behavior is paramount, particularly regarding their singularity (non-invertibility) and the analysis of their smallest singular values. This article delves into ten research papers that shed light on these aspects.
