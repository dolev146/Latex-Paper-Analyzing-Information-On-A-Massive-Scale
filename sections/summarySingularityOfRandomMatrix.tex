\newline\textbf{Collectively,} these articles significantly enhance the understanding of random matrix singularity, demonstrating a remarkable progression from focusing on the specific case of symmetric matrices to a broader application involving various types of discrete random matrices.
The leap from ~\cite{campos2020singularity} improved bounds and methodologies to ~\cite{jain2021singularity} resolution of longstanding conjectures and precision in probability estimates exemplifies a vibrant trajectory of research that broadens the horizon of mathematical inquiry into random matrices. 
Their findings not only underscore the complexity and richness of random matrices as a subject but also pave the way for future explorations in this captivating area of mathematics.
